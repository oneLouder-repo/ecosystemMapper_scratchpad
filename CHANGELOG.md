# Changelog

Dashi uses version numbers like `0.1.0-alpha.1`. While the first number is 0, anything can change between versions. "alpha" means not yet feature complete and still likely to have bugs, but versioned, hosted and ready for invited testers. The version shows on the **alpha** badge in the header and at `/version`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 (first tester release)

The first version meant for people other than its makers. It brings together everything built so far (pull requests #1 to #8) and the fixes and additions below (#9).

### What was already there (#1 to #8)

- **Ecosystem Mapper**: actors, agents, connectors and loops through five systems lenses; many maps per org; dockable tool panels.
- **Strategy & Work**: plans, objectives, goals, workplans and tasks, with Gantt charts, task timelines, measures and toolboxes of assets.
- **Workbench**: dashboard designer, program data, publishing to sites.
- **Podcasts**, **Sites & Pages** and public sites in each org's theme.
- **Library**: documents, folders, annotated bibliographies, lexicons and weekly reading logs.
- **Organisation**, **My profile** and **Help**.
- **Platform server**: many orgs on subdomains, sign-in (password, Google, Facebook, Microsoft), roles, hosted data with live updates, uploads, backups, a security audit, custom domains.

### Fixed

- Staff could not save their own profile (the server refused the whole org document). They can now change their own name, title, picture, interests, bio, pronouns and phone, and nothing else.
- **My profile** broke for someone signed in who isn't on an org's staff list, and could show the admin's profile instead. They now get a clear "you're not a member here" page.
- Two people saving the same document could silently overwrite each other's work. The server now refuses a save made from an out-of-date copy, and the page offers to reload.
- The test sign-in listed every person in one long list. It's now grouped by org and role, with a search box.
- The header added its listeners again on every redraw.
- Mapper: the **Panels** menu could open underneath the panels.

### Added

- **Feedback button** on every page: report a problem, ask a question or suggest an idea. It can include technical details (page, browser, recent errors), and shows exactly what is sent.
- **Support tickets**: **Help → Support** lists your tickets and their replies. **Platform admin → Support** is the queue for the platform admin, with status, priority, replies and internal notes. Email notices when mail is set up.
- **Testing Dashi (alpha)** section in Help: welcome, what to try, how to report, known limits, and what happens to your data.
- **Password reset** and **invitations** by email (Postmark or Resend). Organisation → People shows when each person last signed in, with an Invite or "Send sign-in link" button.
- **Staging mode** (`STAGING=true`): test sign-in and example orgs on a hosted server, a "test server" banner, and an optional access code for the whole site.
- **Version badge** and `/version`.
- Mapper **Panels** menu: dock each panel left or right or float it, reorder, gather, fold and unfold all, tidy, reset. Floating panels come to the front when used. Quick tooltips across the Mapper.
- Library **Add a reading**: upload a file, paste a link or pick a Dashi document, then annotate, tag and file it in a bibliography, all in one form on the library's home page.
- Library **tags**: a tag cloud, a page per tag, rename and merge tags everywhere, and tag suggestions from the bibliography's lexicon. A "What we're reading about" cloud on the dashboard.
- Weekly **briefs** laid out by STEEPLE, micro/meso/macro, the Water of Systems Change, themes or any lexicon facet, with gaps shown. Recommendations, resources and a 500-word state of play counter.
- **Ecosystem maps as assets**: pick a whole map as an asset, keep a map as a file in the library (**To library** in the Mapper), and open a library map file in the Mapper.

### Known limits

See **Help → Testing Dashi (alpha) → Known limits**. In short: no payments yet, no two-factor sign-in, two people editing the same document at once get a reload prompt rather than live co-editing, and one server holds everything.
